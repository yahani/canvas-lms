# Grading Utils

> The Grading Utils extracted in it's own npm package for use across multiple services

The primary consumer of the `@instructure/grading-utils` is `canvas-lms`, so documentation
and references throughout documentation might reflect and assume the use of `canvas-lms`.

## Install and Setup

As a published npm module, you can add `@instructure/grading-utils` to your node project by doing
the following:

```bash
npm install @instructure/grading-utils --save
```

## Tests

The test process already builds the assets so you can just run:

```bash
npm run test
```
